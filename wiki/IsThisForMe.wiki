This website was written for [http://www.twu.ca TWU]'s [http://www.twusa.ca Student Association], so the business model and authentication system are tailored to their needs. It is hoped that this business model may be useful to other individuals out there, and that the website will not heavily depend on the authentication system, but this hope is not expected to ever come to full realization.
